haydnenthusiasts.org
====================

Haydn Enthusiasts website. [Visit it](http://haydnenthusiasts.org/).

### to clone:
```
git clone "https://github.com/jsundram/haydnenthusiasts.org"
cd haydnenthusiasts.org
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### to build:
```
python3 build.py
```

### to watch
```
./watch.sh
```

### to deploy:
```
./deploy.sh
```

now that the site is using cloudfront for https, you may need to force an invalidation
in order for content to update after deploying to s3, something along the lines of:
```
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id EA8YGAHXI8LCE --paths "/index.html"
```

### To avoid the build / watch / deploy steps above:
```
$ git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Then, the site will build, deploy, and invalidate paths appropriately after each commit,
due to the `.githooks/post-commit` script (written in Python3), which is run after each commit.

If it doesn't run, make sure it's executable, and try running it manually from the repository root
```.githooks/post-commit```

### to add new events:
Update `data.json`. 

Keep in mind that the links to fb hosted images usually break, and the practice we've adopted has been downloading the photo from the url we listed in `data.json` and keeping the same name, but storing it in static/assets/event_photos. This is weird, but its how things currently work. 

### to update the haydn info card
* run `git submodule update --remote --merge` to pull the latest haydn info card.
* you may wish to update the screenshots shown on the website (in `static/assets/`); These can be generated by the [haydn-info-card](github.com/jsundram/haydn-info-card) repository.
* git add, git commit, git push and the post-commit hook should take care of the rest.
