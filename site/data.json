            "blurb": "Gabriel's first introduction to the cello wasn't until the age of fifteen. However, he quickly found himself collaborating with some of the most prominent and influential musicians of our time, including Christoph Eschenbach, Yutaka Sado, Yo-Yo Ma, Christopher Hogwood, Kent Nagano, Yakov Kreitzberg and Valery Gergiev.  He has toured with orchestras throughout the United States, Germany, Lithuania, Armenia, Russia and Japan. Gabriel has also enjoyed many experiences as a chamber musician, including a performance of Felix Mendelssohn's String Octet with acclaimed violin virtuoso Cho Liang-Lin, along with James Dunham of the distinguished Cleveland Quartet, and Lynn Harrell among others, in a concert series commemorating the 200th birthday of the composer. Gabriel holds a BM from the New England Conservatory under the instruction of Yeesun Kim, cellist in the acclaimed Borromeo String Quartet.  He also holds an MM from Rice University's Shepherd School of Music under the professorship of world-renowned soloist Lynn Harrell.",
